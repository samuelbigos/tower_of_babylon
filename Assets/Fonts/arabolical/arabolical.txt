Arabolic TTfont. version 1.1 from afontgarde.
Updated, 05-Oct-2000

Loosely parabolic by design, looks vaguely like some 
elegant Middle-Eastern script. 
Hence the Arabolical name. 

Includes numbers and all the usual characters. 

Arabolic may be used freely for any purpose 
(or whatever you think is a fair thing).
